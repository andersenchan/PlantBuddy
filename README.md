# PlantBuddy

 A device which will measure the moisture levels in the soil of a small indoor potted plant and releases a valve to water it based on the observed moisture level. Our device will connect to our database and compare its moisture level to the desired moisture level, and make a decision about whether to water the plant or not. If it cannot connect to WiFi, it will simply water the plant based at a certain time interval. This value will be stored locally.

On top of this, our device will also measure data such as temperature, sunlight levels, and humidity over time. It will keep track of this data about the plants as well as its own data (see below) in a database. This data will be used to determine when to water the plant as well as make suggestions to the user (for example, suggest the user to move the plant to an area with more sunlight if the detected sunlight levels are lower than the ideal sunlight levels needed for this specific plant type). We will also be able to present the data back to the User, and make graphs to help visualize the data. These graphs will be available on a website that the user can log into.
